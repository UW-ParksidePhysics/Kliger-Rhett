%Matrices%
%A matrix is a two-dimensionalarray consisting of m rows and n columns. 
%Special cases are column vectors(n= 1) and row vectors(m=1).
%Column vector m x 1 and row vector is n x 1.

%Example of a row vector, displays horizontally%
v = [1 4 7 10 13] %No need for a semi colon here%

v =

     1     4     7    10    13


%Example of a column vector, displays vertically%

w = [1; 4; 7; 10; 13;] % Again no need for semicolon end%

w =

     1
     4
     7
    10
    13


%To turn a row vector to a column vecotr you can use the transpose operator
% which is " ' " (a single quote). See here...

w = v'

w =

     1
     4
     7
    10
    13


%Thus,v(1)is the first element of vectorv,v(2)its second element, and so forth.
%To access first 3 elements of the vector...

v(1:3) %Should display the first 3 elements of said vector

ans =

     1     4     7


v(3:end) %Should display the third element through the last element 7 10 13

ans =

     7    10    13


%Entering a Matrix%

%begin with a square bracket [
%separate elements in a row with spaces or commas (,)
%use a semicolon (;) to separate rows
%end the matrix with another square bracket, ].

%Example
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9] %Should display a 3X3 matrix

A =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6
     7     8     9

%Once we have entered the matrix, it is automatically stored and remembered in the Workspace. 
%We can refer to it simply as matrix A. 

%We can locate parts of the matrix with code similar to this...
A(2,1)%Finds element in row 2 and column 1, in our previous matrix it is 4

ans =

     4


%We can also change values in our matrix by indexing. See here...
A(3,3)=0 %It was 9 and now I will make it 0.

A =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6
     7     8     0


%Colon Operator%
%It is used to enter matrices with numbers that would make it too large to
%enter one at a time.

x = 0:0.1:5; %Make a matrix that displays from 0 to 5 in increments of 0.1 (It will have 51 elements).
%Line Spacing%

% y=linspace(a,b)generates a row vector y of 100 points linearly spaced between and including a and b.

% y=linspace(a,b,n)generates a row vector y of n points linearly spaced between and including a and b.

% Typing theta = linspace(0,2*pi,101) into command window 
% divides the interval [0,2º] into 100 equal subintervals, then creating a vector of 101 elements.

A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]

A =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6
     7     8     9

A(2,:) %Should output the 2nd row of the matrix: 4 5 6

ans =

     4     5     6

A(:,2:3) %Should ouput the 2 and third columns of the matrix

ans =

     2     3
     5     6
     8     9


%Creating a Sub-Matrix%
%To extract a submatrix B consisting of rows 2 and 3 and columns 1 and 2 of the matrix A, do the following:
B = A([2 3],[1 2]) 

B =

     4     5
     7     8


%To interchange rows 1 and 2 of A, use the vector of row indices together with the colon operator.
C = A([2 1 3],:)

C =

     4     5     6
     1     2     3
     7     8     9


%It is important to note that the colon operator(:) stands forall columns or all rows.

%To create a vector version of matrix A, do the following:
A(:)

ans =

     1
     4
     7
     2
     5
     8
     3
     6
     9


%Deleting a Row or Column%
%To delete a row you can use the following format:

A(3,:) = [] %This will delete the third row in the matrix A so 7 8 and 9 will be gone.

A =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6


%To restore the third row you can use the following format:

A = [A(1,:);A(2,:);[7 8 9]]

A =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6
     7     8     9


%Dimensions%
%to determine the dimensions of a matrix type the following format into the command:

% size(A) it show show the dimensions are 3
%[m,n]=size(A) show the answer more explicitly

%Transposing a Matrix%

%Type A' into the command window and it will make things transposed
%Basically puts rows as columns

%Concatinating Matrices
